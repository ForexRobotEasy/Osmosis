## Code Explanation

The code is written in MQL4, a programming language specifically designed for developing trading robots in the MetaTrader platform. Here is a detailed explanation of the code:

1. Included Libraries: The necessary libraries, Trade and ArrayObj, are included to provide functions and data structures required for trading operations.

2. Constants: Two constants, MAX_LOSS and MAX_SLIPPAGE, are defined to set the maximum loss allowed in percentage and the maximum slippage in points, respectively.

3. Functions:
   - `calculatePriceDifferential`: This function calculates the dynamic price differential by taking the current price and the previous price as input and returning the difference as a percentage.
   - `determineExecutionConditions`: This function is responsible for implementing a flexible and dynamic execution condition system. It should return true if the execution conditions are met, otherwise false.
   - `placeOrders`: This function implements the order placement logic based on the execution conditions. It adjusts orders to secure the best possible price.
   - `setStopLoss`: This function implements a hard stop loss system to limit potential losses.
   - `performTradingFunctions`: This function performs necessary trading functions to support the algorithm and strategies. In this example, it buys when the price differential is positive and sells when negative.
   - `optimizeCodeExecution`: This function is responsible for optimizing the code execution by implementing various code optimization techniques.
   - `testCode`: This function tests the accuracy and reliability of the code by implementing code testing logic.
   - `documentCode`: This function adds necessary comments and explanations to the code for future reference and maintenance.
   - `collaborateWithDevelopmentTeam`: This function collaborates with the software development team to integrate the code seamlessly.
   - `deliverCode`: This function provides necessary support during the integration and testing phase.

4. Entry Point: The `OnStart` function serves as the entry point of the program. It calls the necessary functions in logical order to execute the trading strategy. This includes calculating the price differential, determining execution conditions, setting stop loss, performing trading functions, optimizing code execution, testing code accuracy and reliability, documenting code, collaborating with the development team, and delivering the completed code.
